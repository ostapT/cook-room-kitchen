Cook Room Kitchen is a simple management system for your cafe's or restaurant's cooks.

It's a useful tool for assigning cooks to certain dishes.Â 

If needed, add new dishes to the menu.

If there is a lack of dish categories, you can create a new one.

An option to create accounts for a new cook is also implemented. As far as one has to be registered user to get access to the system.

Only a registered user can create a new account, so no need to worry that a random person will get access to the system.
